## Abstract
Within the context of this assignment, a substantial hands-on encounter with applications of artificial intelligence will be attained, with a particular focus on two pivotal tasks: traditional supervised learning methodologies and prompt engineering. Upon the culmination of this assignment, an adept understanding of the practical implementation of artificial intelligence techniques for the purpose of classification shall be cultivated. Furthermore, through collaborative participation in the curation of prompts and the execution of experiments, the acquisition of insights and skills that are notably advantageous for a group project is anticipated.
